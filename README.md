# Predict health costs

In this project, we attempt to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

# About the dataset
The dataset contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. It contains 1338 rows and 7 features: *age*, *sex*, *bmi*, *children*, *smoker*, *region*, and *expenses*.

The final cell predicts expenses using the test_dataset and graphs the results.
